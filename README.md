==========================================================

These are the assignments with introductory code and explanations in the form of
[IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) created by Paul Groth and
derived from exercises produced by Luís F. Simões for [VU Collective Intelligence
2013](https://github.com/lfsimoes/VU/tree/master/2013__Collective_Intelligence).
Converted to latest Jupyter version and Python 3 and many other updates by
