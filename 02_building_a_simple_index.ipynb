Biessels GJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>This paper appears in a special issue of the European Journal of Pharmacology that commemorates the retirement of Professor Willem Hendrik Gispen as distinguished professor of Utrecht University and as editor of the European Journal of Pharmacology. The paper provides an overview of a research line on the impact of diabetes on cognition that we started together 20 years ago, and that continues to this day. I will report how we more or less stumbled upon this topic, that was understudied, but proved to be of definite clinical relevance. I will discuss how we tried to establish animal models, how developments from clinical and experimental studies from around the world led us to reconsider our concepts, and how findings from research on diabetic neuropathy, insulin signaling in the brain, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and vascular disease and stroke converged and helped to create new ideas and refute others. This voyage has not ended yet, because the ultimate goal is to offer patients with diabetes treatment that can protect them against accelerated cognitive decline. Although this could take another 20 years, the research from Willem Hendrik and his group brought us an important step in the right direction. </em></small><br>[ID: 23872409]"

Ten Brink AF, Hajos TR, van Bennekom C, Nachtegaal J, Meulenbelt HE, Fleuren JF, Kouwenhoven M, Luijkx MM, Wijffels MP, Post MW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The aim of this study was to identify predictors, available at admission, of physical independence at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Secondary aims were to identify predictors of functional gain and length of stay (LOS). We included 1310 adult stroke patients who were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in five Dutch rehabilitation centres. Data on the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Clinical Rehabilitation at admission and discharge (physical and cognitive independence, mood, pain and fatigue), age, sex and in a subsample stroke characteristics as well were collected. A prediction model was created using random coefficient analysis. None of the stroke characteristics were independently associated with physical independence or functional gain at discharge, or LOS. Higher physical and cognitive independence scores and severe pain at admission were predictors of higher physical independence scores at discharge. Furthermore, lower physical independence scores, higher cognitive independence scores, less pain at admission and younger age predicted more functional gain. Finally, lower physical and cognitive independence scores at admission and younger age predicted longer LOS. Physical independence at admission was the most robust predictor for rehabilitation outcome in a Dutch rehabilitation setting. To a lesser extent, age, cognitive independence and pain predicted rehabilitation outcome after stroke. Treatment of cognition and pain should be taken into account during rehabilitation. Further work needs to be carried out to establish whether focusing on these factors improves outcome after rehabilitation.</em></small><br>[ID: 27749516]"

A total of 121 mild-to-moderate stroke patients, who had a paid job at the time of their stroke were included (a) to quantify RTW and work satisfaction one-year post-stroke (using the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation) and (b) to determine factors predicting RTW post-stroke, based on stroke-related, personal and neuropsychological variables. Half of the patients were not in work (28%) or were working less (22%) than pre-stroke. Ninety percent of those in fulltime employment post-stroke were satisfied with their occupational situation, against 36% of the unemployed participants. In regards to factors predicting RTW, global cognitive functioning (r = .19, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and depressive symptoms (r = -.16, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at two months post-stroke onset were associated with return to work within one year. Only global cognitive functioning was an independent predictor of RTW (11.3% variance, p = .013). Although the explained variance was not that high, neuropsychological factors probably play a pivotal role in returning to work and should be taken into account during rehabilitation after mild and moderate stroke.</em></small><br>[ID: 28441897]"

Understanding their relationship could inform treatment approaches to improve participation. We investigated the relationship between social cognition and participation in the long term after stroke. Of 395 patients participating in a large prospective cohort study, cross-sectional data were available at 3-4 years post-stroke of 118 patients on tests for emotion recognition, theory of mind, empathy, and behaviour regulation. Participation was assessed with the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation - Participation (USER-P). Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between social cognitive domains and participation. The majority suffered from minor stroke (83.1% scored NIHSS 0-4). Only behaviour regulation was related to participation restrictions in bivariate analysis, but social cognitive impairments did not predict participation restrictions in multivariate regression in this group. To conclude, in a sample of minor stroke patients with mild impairments in theory of mind, emotion recognition and behavioural control, there were no associations with restrictions in participation. Research should examine whether a relationship is present in patients with more severe stroke. In addition, measuring social aspects of participation is necessary to further unravel this relationship, to determine treatment targets for improving participation.</em></small><br>[ID: 31854264]"

Spanish versions of the following instruments were used: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), Memory Failures in Everyday (MFE), Executive Complaint Questionnaire (ECQ). Statistical analysis included ANOVA, path analysis, and multiple logistic regression. Stressed workers showed lower work engagement and more cognitive complaints, even after adjusting for demographic variables.

    "Similarly as above, implement the function `or_merge` outlined below that executes an OR merging of the lists. The resulting list should therefore include all the elements that appear in at least one of the lists (note this is an 'inclusive OR' and not a 'XOR'). Again, this operation should take advantage of the input lists being sorted already, should not perform any additional sorting operation, and should go through each of the input lists just once. Elements that appear in both input list should only appear once in the output list. Test your function again with an example."
